Monthly Salary Calcky allows employers to provide employee information such as first and last name, employee ID number, job title, and annual salary to 
track if employee annual salaries exceed the $20,000 monthly budget. If the total monthly salaries exceeds the monthly budget, the total monthly will turn red

To build Monthly Salary Calcky:

1. In a text editor like VSCode, create files such as index.html, client.js, jquery.js and stylesheet.css.
2. In the html head, create the boiler plate and source in the jquery file before the javascript file then source the css file.
3. In the body, create labels for the input fields inside <div>. Labels should be first name, last name, ID number, job title, and annual salary.

5. Create a table with headers of the input. This is where the input will display on the DOM.
6. Create another table to display the total monthly.
7. In the javascript file,
